<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are revolutionizing the field of machine learning by en-
abling the analysis of graph-structured data, which is pervasive in domains such as social net-
works, molecular biology, and recommendation systems. Unlike traditional neural networks
designed for grid-like data structures, GNNs utilize a message-passing mechanism, enabling
nodes to iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. This tutorial, titled ‚ÄùGraph
Neural Networks: From Zero to Hero,‚Äù introduces Sri Lankan researchers to the foundational
concepts, advanced methodologies, and practical applications of GNNs.The tutorial spans
eight modules, covering basics like graph theory and linear algebra, advanced GNN architec-
tures such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs),
and hands-on sessions using PyTorch Geometric (PyG). Applications explored include molec-
ular property prediction, traffic forecasting, and computer vision tasks such as human action
recognition. Special topics like graph expressivity, structural encoding, and challenges like
oversmoothing are also addressed. Participants will gain insights into cutting-edge develop-
ments like Geometric Deep Learning and Topological Neural Networks, paving the way for
further research. This initiative is crucial, given the under-representation of GNN research in
local conferences despite its global prominence. Through engaging, hands-on sessions leverag-
ing Python and Google Colab, the tutorial caters to a diverse audience of students, academics,
and industry professionals, requiring only foundational knowledge in deep learning and graph
theory.This tutorial is organized by researchers from the BrAIN Labs Research Group at the
Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT).</p>
